3.remove unnecessary files from folder of react
4.remove all the css codes

5.key points for React Developer
i.Decide on Components
ii.Decide the state and where it lives
iii.What changes when state changes

evening session

1.make the folder for
i.components--for reusable codes
ii.pages--for not resulable that is fixed on app .this is problly used once in the app
its also the component but not resulable

2.make a first page i.e homepage always right folder in lowercase but component
in PascalCase
inside homepage lets make homepage component

In the homepage homepage is main component inside homepage there is directory-menu component
inside this there is menu-item inside menu-item there is content that is title and subtitile

we do simple without react but what we want to do is 
homepage import the directory menu component and inside directory-menu  we make menu-component
homepage --> directory-menu-->menu-item-->content

then i make indiviual component for directory and menuitem
and in the directory i use class based bcoz to store data in the state and passed to the menuitem 
in the menuitem i use img title subtitle from the data 




Day 2 7:11 Am --
i make directory as class based component and inside render i use map method to iterate over thes
section and passed the id,imageUrl and title as props to the MenuItem component

to use images i use the style method 
style = {{backgroundImage:`url($imageUrl)}}` which dynamically fetch the image which is as props

evening time:

React Routing:
-->single page application means yeutai file html css js ma multiple page haru
jasto hamro app ma shop and signin page haru
react routing ley navigation without page reloading provide garxa 
then we add npm install react-router
i.index.js import {BrowserRouter} from react-router-dom wrap the App component with BrowserRouter it provides all functionality
for routing that means <BrowserRouter><App/></BrowserRouter>

ii.Route 
import Route
<Route path exact component />
path is location of component 
exact is used to render only that component not other if homepage only homepage is render not other page
component ={nameOfComponent}

iii.Switch 
to use Switch we wrap the Route 
its used to check that the location is match or not
its gives more control over the code 


15.react-router-dom



Day 3 
6:30

when we passed the component in the Route it gives the three properties
i.match
-->url '/' it just matches / if i typed the /dkfdskf still it match oonly / all the url of the component
--> path is the pattern that we have passed in the Route component
--> isExact is only true when entire url is matched
-->params is an object of url properties its used to jsto kisanbasyal/profile/id 
or kunai shopping page ma yo item ma jan paro vani hats/12

-->History
its used to navigate to diffrent pages


WithRouter

-->its used for those component which has no access of history props.we only pass route in 
homepage thats why it  gives history but what about shop page hats page to acess the history props
.in that case we use the WithRouter properties
how to WithRouter
firsst import {WithRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
 then at the end wrap the component with WithRouter(App);


DAY 4
Let's Commit the code
1.git add .
2.git add -A   
3.git commit -m ""
4.git push origin master

we need to make the shopPage as class based component because its store the data related to
collection item 
shop page ma collections state ma shop_data rakhiyo which has information of the items


next we have to build the Preview collection component which is responsible to iterate over the
collection and passed to the collection_item component


evening 9:00 pm 4/24/2021

there is  no need of state so we make it functional component .
and pass the parameter i.e id,name ,price,imageUrl that is come from shopPage

then we have ready with the collection_item and import it on collection_preview
on that we pass ...otherItemsProps


5/26/2021

import{ReactComponent as logo} from './'

then put all the images in the folder that is assets


after 11 AM 
now lets learn forms in react 
state is placed onto the signin and signup component not in the signin page component
we should decide where the state lives thats why signin has own state and signup has own state they reallly
dont care about each other

first create sign-in-and-sign-up page
we make this functional component because all the state are placed in their own component

 google authentication  part 3
 in this part we wil see how to signout our authentication
 we have the service of auth .signout but where to put it
 our header should be aware of user sign in so that we make it signout option

 if currentuser exits then its signout if not signin
currentuser ? 
div onclicl = auth.signout>
:
